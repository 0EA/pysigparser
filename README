Python signatures parser with uses XML-RPC interface.

Currently looks for Email addresses and Web-sites in signature.

Usage: start the server with "python server.py"
Server is ready to accept connections and parse the data.

In another terminal you may check the client or check tests.

Usage of client:
python client.py -f <filename.sig>

 The script connects to XML-RPC server
sending the data from <filename.sig>
and prints received JSON

 Example: python client.py -f <path-to>/tests/1.sig


Usage of tests:
"python tests.py" starts tests.

The directory tests/signatures has pairs of .sig and .json files.
Tests send each .sig file to server and compare with corresponding expected .json file.
The server must be running at this moment.
